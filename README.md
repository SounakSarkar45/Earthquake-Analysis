Some important findings in the data are as below:
The scatter plot of magnitude and cdi shows a positive 
relationship. Frequency distribution analysis reveals the 
distribution of data points across different magnitudes and 
intensities.
The correlation matrix indicates relationships between 
variables, with magnitude showing positive correlations with 
cdi and mmi. Analysis of earthquake frequency by year 
highlights temporal variability, with some years experiencing 
higher seismicity than others. The distribution of earthquake 
magnitudes shows a concentration in the range of 6.5 to 7.1, 
with a slightly right-skewed distribution. The distribution of 
earthquake depths indicates a wide range of values, with a 
higher concentration of shallow earthquakes. A positive
correlation between magnitude and sig suggests that larger 
earthquakes tend to have a greater impact.
